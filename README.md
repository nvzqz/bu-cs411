# Boston University - CS 411

This repository contains the work on a group project for Boston University's
CS 411 course.

## Proposal

Go Wherever: Upload a photo and get an instant itinerary.

When the user uploads a photo to Go Wherever, a location recognizer attempts to find where the photo was taken. It will use the Wikipedia API to find info on places in the area and then find local hotels and costs via Expedia's API.

APIs used:

Wikipedia
BookingSync
Expedia
Google Cloud Vision
