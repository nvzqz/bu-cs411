# Boston University - CS 411

This repository contains the work on a group project for Boston University's
CS 411 course.

## Proposal

Spotitunes: Transfer your playlists between Spotify and Apple Music.

Spotitunes leverages the Spotify and Apple Music APIs to allow users to select any public playlist from your account in one service and duplicate it in the other. The user pastes a link to their public playlist into Spotitunes and it will then automagically recreate it in the other music service.

APIs used:

Spotify
Apple Music

## Usage

install npm
bower install anguler-route

set up local server by
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888
ps: dont change to other port, because the callback url is added to the spotify whitelist.
