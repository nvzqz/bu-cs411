# Project Proposal

**Date:** Thursday, 2019-09-19

## Idea 1

**Spotitunes:** Transfer your playlists between Spotify and Apple Music.

Spotitunes leverages the Spotify and Apple Music APIs to allow users to select
any public playlist from your account in one service and duplicate it in the
other. The user pastes a link to their public playlist into Spotitunes and it
will then automagically recreate it in the other music service.

APIs used:
- [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)
- [Apple Music](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applemusicapi)

## Idea 2

**Go Wherever:** Upload a photo and get an instant itinerary.

When the user uploads a photo to Go Wherever, a location recognizer attempts to
find where the photo was taken. It will use the Wikipedia API to find info on
places in the area and then find local hotels and costs via Expedia's API.

APIs used:
- Wikipedia
- BookingSync
- Expedia
- Google Cloud Vision
