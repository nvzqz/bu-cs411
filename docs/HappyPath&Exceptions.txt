This is the Happy Path and possible exceptions for Primary Story 1:
As a user who just switched to Spotify/Apple Music, I want to transfer all my playlists to the new service automatically. If I have to do it song by song, the experience will be time-consuming and mundane.

Happy path:
1. Direct user to the Spotify page for login
2. Display playlists and transfer button for user to choose for transfer
3. Start transferring the playlist from Spotify to Apple Music 
   once user pressed the transfer button
4. Notify user when the transfer is complete

Exceptions: 
1. Spotify login failure
2. No playlists found in user's library
3. No songs found in the selected playlist
4. No songs found in Apple Music

Step(s) to cause Exceptions:
1. Enter the wrong User ID/Email Address or Password
2. Login into Spotify -> Having an empty library in Spotify
3. Login into Spotify -> Select an empty playlist
4. Login into Spotify -> Select a playlist with all of its songs not offered by Apple Music
