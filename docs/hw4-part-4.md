# HW4 Part 4 - Architecture for Solution
##### Team Pugs
For our back end, we elected to use Python because of our familiary it with it. Because 
many of us began our coding experience here at BU with Python, we all have around 2 years 
of experience under our belts. Python is also a valid choice as it has grown in popularity 
for back end usev in recent years. Additionally, it fits nicely into our LAMP stack 
as a replacement for PHP, which is new to all of us and is also commonly touted as 
difficult to work with.

We chose not to use a Javascript framework like Node because it would require learning 
an entirely new set of syntax rules to all of us and it is not a common component of the LAMP 
stack. It also would complicate our Git repository slightly as it already contains several 
.js files, and we want to keep the repository as clean as possible.
